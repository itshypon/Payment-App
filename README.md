## Basic Version of Payment App
Basic Payment App created using React, Node and MongoDB. To run MongoDB locally, we have to run replica-set(multiple nodes using `run-rs -v 4.0.0 --shell` to prevent transaction error).
Basic functionality is added like authentication and transfering balance, although it needs more improvement.
